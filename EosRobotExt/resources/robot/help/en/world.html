        <h1>World</h1>
        <p>
        A world is required to use a robot. In order to use a world you should created it beforehand with the world editor and load it.
        If you don't do that the world will be empty with a single entrance. </p>
        <p>
        A world can contain any numbe rof entrances. These are the starting points for the robots. Everytime a robot
        enters a world, it is placed at the first free entrance.</p>
        <p>
        Worlds are creted and save with the world editor. A robot program can load such worlds. For it work reliably,
        you have to save your work in the same folder that contains the world.</p>

        <h1>CarEv3</h1>
        <p>Objects of this class serve as remote control of a Lego Ev3 robot.
        The objects have no attributs. Calls to methods are redirected to the robot.
        Therefore it is crucial to call the connect method as first. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before to can use this class the first time you have to prepare the Lego Ev 3 robot.
        <ol>
        <li>The robot should be built after the basic Lego Ev3 edu modell.
        <li>The robot needs to have a connection with the ultrasonic sensor at port 4 and the gyro sensor connect at port 1.
        <li>The robot must be booted with a Lejos sd card.
        <li>The robot must be connected to the same network as the computer running eos.
        <li>The program EosServer.jar has to run on the robot.
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to create the sd card, you need the lejos image and the lego jvm from Oracle.
        The flash program can be started by starting the EosLejosExt.jar file.
        A detailed description how to create the sd card can be found on the lejos homepage. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A wifi dongle allows to connect the robot to a wifi.
        You can use the really compact ones. After the robot was booted from the lejos sd card,
        it can easily be connected to your wifi.
        In theory it would be possilbe to use bluetooth, but wifi is the much better choice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program EosServer.jar can be directly transfered and started using the lejos control program.
        The server waits for commands from eos and translates them to motor control commands.
        If you want to use a different robot model you have to write your server or adapt the EosServer program.
        Depending on the used wheels, wheel distance, sensor configuration you need different motor and sensor commands.
        If you want to use a completly different modell, eg a cran, you have to modify EosLejosExt.jar as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <h3>connect(name:String)</h3>
        Eos 2 establishes a tcp/ip connection to the robot. If it is successful the robot changes its color
        and plays a sound. The connection will automatically be terminated when the program ends.
        <h3>turnLeft(angle:Integer)</h3>
        The robot turns to the left. It tries to turn the given angle, but the
        exact angle depends on many external conditions like the surface.
        Therefore the angle will not be really exact.
        <h3>turnRight(angle:Integer)</h3>
        The robot turn to the right.
        <h3>moveForward(distance:Integer)</h3>
        The robot moves the given distance in milimeter forward.
        Depending on the battery level, the surface, the motor the robot will not exactly drive forward.
        It can't be avoides that it will always drive a little curve. The wheels
        will never be exactly adjusted.
        <h3>moveBackward(distance:Integer)</h3>
        The robot drives backwards.
        <h3>distance()</h3>
        This methods read out the ultra sonic sensor. The distance to the next obstacle is
        in millimeter with an accurasity of about 2 centimeter.
        <h3>angle()</h3>
        Reads the value from the gyro sensor. 0 degree is the starting orientation. 
        The angle has a precision of about 3 degrees
        <h3>honk()</h3>
        The robot plays a sound.

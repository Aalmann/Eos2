        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <p>
        Comments are texts that are part of the source code, but not part of the program. That means they will not be executed.
        Every programming language has some way to add comments. They can contain anything (few exceptions) without changing the behaviour of the program.
        </p>
        <p>
        They are needed in order to add explaining text and remarks to a program.
        This is necessary in order to better understand programs.
        You should allways write a comment, if the source code is not self explaining, or there are informations one has
        to know to understand the code, which are not obvious. </p>
        <p>
        That way comments on the one hand help understanding a program faster and better. On the other hand if a program get more complex,
        it can happen that you forget yourself what you did and the comment reminds you what the program is doing.
        </p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <h3>Line comment</h3>
        <p><b>//</b> The rest of the line is a comment no matter what it contains.</p>
        Line comments are useful for adding comments behind commands.
        <h3>Area comment</h3>
        <p><b>/*</b> Text between /* and */ is a comment <b>*/</b></p>
        or as alternativ
        <p><b>{</b> text between curly braces is a comment<b>}</b></p>
        Area comments can be place anywhere, where a blanc is legal. Therfore they can be placed within lines.
    <h2>Example</h2>
<code>c:Circle<span style="color:green">&nbsp;//That's&nbsp;a&nbsp;circle<br>
</span><span style="color:green">{this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;multiline&nbsp;comment.<br>
second&nbsp;line<br>
third&nbsp;line.}</span><br>
c.move(-<span style="color:blue">1</span><span style="color:green">/*to&nbsp;the&nbsp;left*/</span>,<span style="color:blue">1</span><span style="color:green">/*up*/</span>)</code>    </body>

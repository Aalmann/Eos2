    <h1>Window</h1>
    <p>The window is needed to show figures. If you do not create a window object by yourself, the
    system will create own for you atm you create any figure object. Every figure object will be automatically 
    added to that window. You only have to create your own window if you want to call window methods.
    But then you have to add every figure by yourself.</p>
    <p>Every unit is millimeter (mm) (25.4mm = 1 inch). EOS will trust you operation system.
    If your os delivers wrong dpi (dots per inch) values, the figures will have the wrong size.
    You can assume the values will be accurate with an error of about 10%.</p>            
    <h2>Setter- and Getter-Methods</h2>

        the property value.<br>

    <h1>Declaration</h1>
    <p>
    A declaration defines a variable. In EOS this will implicitly create an object
    and store it in the fresh variable. With the exception that classes that are 
    only general terms like figure, linefigure amd filledfigure will be empty.
    You can store any object that is subsumed under that general term in such a variable.
    If you access such an abstract variable before storing an object in it the program will
    terminate with an error message.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the whole program does not contain a variable of the class window and at least one 
    figure, a window object is automatically created an every figure object will be automatically
    added to it. This behaviour excludes procedures as they cannot access global variables.    
    </p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>name:class</p>
    <p>Creates a variable with that name, which contains a new object.</p>
    <p>name_1, name_2, ..., name_n:class</p>                                  
    <p>Creates multiple variables at once.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>          
    <code>
      eyeLeft, eyeRight:Ellipse<br>
      mouth:Rectangle<br>
      face:Circle<br>
      nose:Triangle<br>
    </code>

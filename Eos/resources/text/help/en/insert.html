    The command insert allows to include other eos programs with out copying them.
    The command includes the whole text of the referred program into this program. 
    </p>        
    <p>
    There are some limitations:
    </p>        
    <ol>        
      <li>
      The insert command can only use relative pathes if the including program was opened or saved.
      If the program was directly written within the ditor without saving it, the computer cannot know where to search for the include.
      </li>        
      <li>
      The included program must we syntactically correct. That mean word pairs like repeat *repeat must be closed.
      Variables and other semantic requirements only have to be correct for the whole program.
      </li>        
    </ol>
